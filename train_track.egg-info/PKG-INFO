Description: sage-train-track
        ================
        
        Free group automorphisms and train-track representatives in python/sage. 
        
        This is a Sage optional package. It contains code to handle free group
        automorphisms (inversion, composition, etc.) and to compute
        train-track representatives (absolute and relative, stable and
        unstable) as defined by Bestvina and Handel. This includes the
        computation of Nielsen paths and indices of iwip automorphisms and
        much more. Convex cores of pairs of tree as defined by Guirardel also
        appear.
        
        Installation::
        
          sage -pip install train_track
        
        Warning: it seems that Mac OS X 10.13 has a security conflict between
        SIP and SSL and does not succeed in downloading the package from
        https://pypi.python.org. To overcome this difficulty, just download
        the tarball train_track-0.1.1.tar.gz from
        
          https://pypi.python.org/simple/train_track
        
        and run::
        
          sage -pip install /path/to/train_track-0.1.1.tar.gz
        
        Warning: if you lack intstallation privilege, you can install only for
        yourself::
        
          sage -pip install --user train_track
          
        On Cocalc.com installation can be done either from a terminal as above
        or from a cell::
        
          !sage -pip install train_track
        
        Warning, Cocalc free accounts do not have access to internet, first
        download the tarball then install.
          
        Usage::
        
            sage: from train_track import *
        
        
        After this command, you can play with free groups and their automorphisms::
        
            sage: FreeGroup('a,b,c')
            Free Group on generators {a, b, c}
            sage: FreeGroupAutomorphism('a->bCb,b->Bc,c->BcBa')
            Automorphism of the Free Group on generators {a, b, c}: a->a*b,b->a*c,c->a
            sage: free_group_automorphisms.Cohen_Lustig_1_6()
            Automorphism of the Free Group on generators {a, b, c}: a->c^3*a*c^-3,b->c^-1*a*c^2*a^-1*b*c^-1,c->a*c^2*a^-1*b*c^2*a*c^-2*b^-1*a*c^-2*a^-1*c^4*a^-1*c^-3
